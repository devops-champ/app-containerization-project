## Dockerize the Backend Framework

It all starts with creating a `Dockerfile` (Yes, without extension) under the root of the `backend-flask' folder.

Add the following contents in `Dockerfile`:
```
FROM python:3.10-slim-buster

WORKDIR /backend-flask

COPY requirements.txt .

RUN pip3 install -r requirements.txt

COPY . .

ENV FLASK_ENV=development

EXPOSE 5000

CMD [ "python3", "-m" , "flask", "run", "--host=0.0.0.0", "--reload"]
```

Let's understand what each command does:

`FROM` - Every Dockerfile beings with `FROM` command. It defines the base image your app is built on. The base image contains the necessary library, runtime, dependinces etc. Since weâ€™re using Flask (a Python framework), we use the official Python base image python:3.10-slim-buster, which is a lightweight version suitable for smaller container sizes.

`WORKDIR` - Use this command to set the default directory inside container terminal. For example, when you log into ubuntu machine, and fireup the terminal, the prompt is at /home/{name}. Likewise when you login to container, the prompt is at /backend-flask. Also the subsiquent steps like copying files, running commands all happend from this directory.

`COPY` - Use this command to copy local files into container's `WORKDIR`.
You might get a question like why are copying only requirements.txt? why not complete backend-flask folder? Reason being when building a Docker image, it's a good practice to copy only what's necessary at each step to take advantage of Docker's layer caching.To load the python libraries all we need is `requirements.txt`. So by copying only requirements.txt and running pip install, Docker caches this layer. If you later change your application code but not requirements.txt, Docker reuses the cached layer instead of reinstalling dependencies, making builds faster. 

By copying `requirements.txt` separately, we ensure dependency installation is cached independently.

`RUN` - Use this command to run commands during the image build process. It is used for setup stuff to install packages, configure the system, or prepare the application environment. So basically when you run `docker build` command, the RUN command contents are loaded.

`ENV` - You can set any environment variables required for your application.

`EXPOSE` - It is for documenation purpose only to let know users that app will be served on the mentioned port.

`CMD` - Use this command what to run when a container starts. 


To see container in action, you must follow these two steps:

Build the docker:
```
$ sudo docker build -t backend-flask ./backend-flask
```
here -t means tag. tags have `image-name:{image_version}` format.
If you don't mention the tag, then it defaults to latest i.e `image-name:latest`

Run the docker:
```
$ sudo docker run -p 5000:5000 -d --name flask backend-flask:latest
```

-p = publish port. It has {host_port}:{container_port} format.
-d = run the container in detatched node
--name = name of the container. If you don't specify it, Docker will assign a random name.
