# App Containerization Project

### What is Containerization Technology? Why someone must use it?

Containers came into existence because of "it works in my system". As a developer when you're bulding applications you might have set of frameworks, libraries, dependenices, and runtime enivronments configured into your system. Similarly the stage and prod environments might have standard environments configured. When you deploy your code into stage or prod and there's a mismatch with the configuration, then the application might thrown an error. Contianers addressed these problems by providing portability features
